# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
The callback function is being called/invoked in in the method instead of just being passed as an argument.

# Teacher Feedback

Not quite, it is because we are invoking the callback function.
